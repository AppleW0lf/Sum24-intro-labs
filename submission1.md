### Task 1: SSH Commit Signature Verification
**Importance of Signed Commits**

Signed commits are crucial for securing Git repositories. They confirm that the person claiming to make the changes is actually the one who did. When authors sign their commits, they use cryptography to prove their identity. This protection prevents unauthorized alterations or false claims of authorship, ensuring the repository's history is reliable.
